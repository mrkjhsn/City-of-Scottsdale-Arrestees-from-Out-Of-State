## City of Scottsdale Arrestees from Other States

While exploring the City of Scottsdale Police Department [arrest dataset](http://data.scottsdaleaz.gov/dataset/police-departmental-arrest-data)* I noticed the City, State, and Zip are included for each person arrested.  This motivated me to analyze the relationship between out of state arrestees in Scottsdale versus the percent of visitors to Scottsdale from various states.  Each year the City of Scottsdale publishes a [visitor research report](https://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/Assets/ScottsdaleAZ/Tourism+Reports/2019+Visitor+Report+Longwoods.pdf), which includes the top 10 states that contribute visitors to Scottsdale.  

In addition to using SQL for the quantitative analysis.  I used an ArcGIS feature in PowerBI to develop cluster maps in order to visually show the states and cities of people who have been arrested in Scottsdale.

#### Results:

Overall the percentages of visitors from various states and the percent of people being arrested from those states aligned.  However:
1. Colorado contributes the 2nd most visitors from out of state, but it ranks 6th in terms of states of residence for people who have been arrested in Scottsdale.  
2. New York contributes the 4th largest number of visitors, but it's 10th on the list of arrestees.  
3. Washington isn't even in the top 10 states that contribute visitors to Scottsdale, but it ranks number 4 on the list of arrestees.

#### Next Steps:

~~1. The Scottsdale Visitor Report also includes information that includes the top 13 cities that contributed visitors to AZ.  Analize this against cities of arrestees.~~

~~2. Make a map showing areas of concentration at cities that have contributed visitors to Scottsdale that have been arrested.~~
 
 3. Explore how these percentages change from year to year.  Currently, the City of Scottsdale doesn't provide year over year data.
